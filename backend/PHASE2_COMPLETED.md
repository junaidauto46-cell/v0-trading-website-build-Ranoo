4. On approval: funds added to balance, referral commission calculated
5. Email notifications sent at each step

### Withdrawal Workflow
1. User checks eligibility (balance + referral requirement)
2. System validates 2 referrals with approved deposits
3. Creates pending withdrawal request
4. Admin approves/rejects with notes
5. On approval: funds deducted from balance
